			   <p>Carnival's highest responsibility and top priorities are compliance, environmental protection, the communities we visit, and the health, safety and well-being of all guests, crew, and shoreside employees. Highlights of Carnival's newly-adopted health <a href="https://www.carnivalcorp.com/Updates-on-Cruise-Operations">protocols</a> include testing of all passengers and crew for COVID-19 prior to departure, mandatory mask-wearing for all passengers and crew, improved ventilation to increase fresh air onboard, and onboard medical facilities for isolation and quarantine, and the ability to make arrangements with private providers at various ports of call. Following CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0402-conditional-sail-orders.html">guidelines</a>, Carnival will also be incorporating vaccination plans for all crew members.</p>

            <p><strong>Persuasion Theory</strong></p>
           <p>With health and safety concerns at the forefront of Audience A's purchasing decisions, and the reliance on the expertise and trustworthiness of the source delivering the persuasive message, <a href="http://www.cios.org/encyclopedia/persuasion/Helaboration_2routes.htm">central processing</a> is most appropriate. The message of safety is also congruent to this audiences' attitudes and beliefs to exceed health and safety standards. Audience A will pay very close attention to the messaging information and will carefully examine the message's arguments, according to O'Keefe's <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/elaboration-likelihood-model-theory-using-elm-to-get-inside-the-user-s-mind">Elaboration Likelihood Model</a>. The audience will carefully consider the message's claims and arguments, and will be guided by the expertise of the communicator, which is in the form of a safe and clean ship.</p>

           <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
           <p>Members of Audience A are predominantly white/Caucasian, over the age of 45 and are married couples who are well-educated with both college graduates and postgraduates. The average household income would be in the range of $90,000 or more, with the travelers to either be employed full-time, or retired. Geographic location of this audience is not relevant as they would have the means to travel to different <a href="https://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise/Carnival-Cruise-Line/Ports">ports</a> regardless of where they reside in the United States. Members of Audience A are frequent travelers, have loyalty to Carnival Cruise Lines and have taken many <a href="https://www.cruises.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw07qDBhBxEiwA6pPbHo2wAXlRI9um8ceZIoCSAVbx_-BkZZj-LWxAcX94v_0ajKpdd9bB6xoCSUIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">cruise</a> vacations with Carnival over the years.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			   <p><strong>The Design of this Page</strong></p>
			   <p>The design choice, to use different shades of blue, is to be reminiscent of a clear blue sky and ocean water, with the white backgrounds as a reminder of clouds and the white caps of ocean waves. The color <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-color-psychology-of-blue-2795815">blue</a> is viewed as a non-threatening color and evokes feelings of calmness or serenity, which is the focus of the campaign. The repetition of the same font throughout and the use of images that are clean, clear, and without human clutter, <a href="https://masscommtheory.com/theory-overviews/framing-theory/">reflects</a> Carnival's preparedness across their entire fleet of ships, and the clean lines emphasize cleanliness, <a href="https://cruising.org/en/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/Public-Health-and-Medical">health</a>, and safety.&nbsp;</p>
